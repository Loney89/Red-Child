# Red-Child
Red Child is a League APi Web Interface Tool

We'll be using a few tools to do this, but first you'll need Composer and PHP at the very least. If you get Composer from their website just use their .exe or manual methods to install.

Then pull down this repo and use the Compser install/update from command line in that directory. Do not include the vendor directory into this repo.
